SMAC and KAC are outdated, VAC dosent do its Job, NoCheatz-4 is discontinued and Community Projects are often small or unstable.
I hope this Plugin will help some Server Owners even doe its still in an early Stage of development.
Ime still working on my own AC System, so dont exspect massive Changes here. Propapbly i will merge this Project some Day into "Cheat Acid".
Since i havent implemented an Updater yet (or renewed the old one), watch this Project on GitHub so you will be informed about Updates.
