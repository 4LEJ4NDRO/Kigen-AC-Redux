I have just fixed a few things on the last Dev Version of KAC.
Ime still working on my own AC System, so dont exspect huge Changes here.

SMAC and KAC are outdated, VAC dosent do its Job and NoCheatz-4 is discontinued.
I hope this Plugin will help some People, i try to keep it up-to-date so there is at least one maintained Community AC Project.

Since i havent implemented an Updater yet (or renewed the old one), watch this Project on GitHub so you will be informed about Updates.
