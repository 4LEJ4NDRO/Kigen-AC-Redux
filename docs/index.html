SMAC and KAC are outdated, VAC dosent do its Job, NoCheatz-4 is discontinued and Community Projects are often small and pretty unstable.
I hope this Plugin will help some Server Owners even doe its still in Alpha Stage.
Ime still working on my own AC System, so dont exspect massive Changes here. Still i will propapbly merge this Someday into my own Cheat Acid.
Since i havent implemented an Updater yet (or renewed the old one), watch this Project on GitHub so you will be informed about Updates.
